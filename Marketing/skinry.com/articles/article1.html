            <h1>Skinry Face Cleaner App</h1>

            <p>Skinry is a newly developed mobile app, which scans the face and counts the acne or pimples on the face.
                This app can greatly benefit women and men too. The app shows the exact count of pimples on the face,
                and provides you with instructions and recommendations on how to clean the face. With this app, you can
                make your face cleaner, and look more feminine at all time even on the go.</p>

            <p>Skinry is the newest app for smartphones, tablets, and android that will help lots of women make their
                face cleaner, more beautiful, and more radiant. This app is very smart in a way that it counts the exact
                number of pimples on your face, plus tells you exactly where the pimples on your face are located. After
                telling you how may pimples you have on your face, the app will provide you with simple, yet effective
                and safe recommendations on how to get rid of pimples.</p>

            <p>Girls and ladies can determine the right pimple removing product to use with this app. Skinry provides
                users with the opportunity to find the right dermatological products based on their skin type, age, and
                types of pimples on the face. Remember that not all skin care products for the face are suitable for
                everyone. A pimple removal product that works best on a person with dry skin may not work on another
                person with oily skin.</p>

            <p>Additionally, the app tracks the history of the face clearness. Use the app to determine the exact number
                of pimples you have on your face and follow the recommendations to get rid of them. After the pimples on
                your face are lessened, put your phone in front of your face to track the clearness of your face. This
                will enable you to track the progress of the cosmetics and your diet in reducing your pimples.</p>

            <p>Finally, Skinry provides you with recommendations on how to clean your face naturally. This means that
                the app provides you with the basic facial cleaning procedures at home such as how to clean your face,
                and what make up to use and not to use with regard to your skin condition, your age, etc.</p>

            <p>What makes Skinry the best is that people do not need to spend much time to track the progress of their
                diet and cosmetics. Instead of spending too much time in front of the mirror in the bathroom looking for
                visible pimples on your face, you can scan your face with your phone and determine if you have
                eliminated your pimples or not. Through this way, you can look for other pimple removal products, if the
                previous one doesn’t work for you.</p>

            <p>Skinry will be released in App Store and Google Play, but you can view its full information at <a
